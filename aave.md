# Pool

This contract is the main user-facing contract. Most user interactions with the Aave Protocol occur via the `Pool` contract. It exposes the liquidity management methods that can be invoked using either _**Solidity**_ or _**Web3**_ libraries.

`Pool.sol` allows users to:

- Supply
- Withdraw
- Borrow
- Repay
- Enable/disable supplied assets as collateral
- Liquidate positions
- Execute Flash Loans

Pool is covered by a proxy contract and is owned by the [`PoolAddressesProvider`](./pool-addresses-provider) of the specific market. All admin functions are callable by the [`PoolConfigurator`](./pool-configurator) contract defined in the [`PoolAddressesProvider`](./pool-addresses-provider).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol).

## Write Methods

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(IPoolAddressesProvider provider) external virtual
```

Initializes the Pool.

Function is invoked by the proxy contract when the `Pool` contract is added to the [`PoolAddressesProvider`](./pool-addresses-provider) of the market.

Caches the address of the [`PoolAddressesProvider`](./pool-addresses-provider) in order to reduce gas consumption on subsequent operations.

#### Input Parameters:

| Name     | Type      | Description                              |
| :------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| provider | `address` | The address of the PoolAddressesProvider |

### supply

```solidity
function supply(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
) public virtual override
```

Supplies a certain `amount` of an `asset` into the protocol, minting the same amount of corresponding aTokens and transferring them to the `onBehalfOf` address. For example, if a user supplies 100 USDC and onBehalfOf address is the same as `msg.sender`, they will get 100 aUSDC in return.

The `referralCode` is emitted in Supply event and can be for third-party referral integrations. To activate the referral feature and obtain a unique referral code, integrators need to submit a proposal to Aave Governance.

> [!WARNING]
> When supplying, the `Pool` contract must have `allowance()` to spend funds on
> behalf of `msg.sender` for at least the amount for the asset being supplied.
> This can be done via the standard ERC20 `approve()` method on the underlying
> token contract.

> [!NOTE]
> Referral supply is currently inactive, you can pass `0` as `referralCode`.
> This program may be activated in the future through an Aave governance
> proposal.

#### Input Parameters:

### withdraw

```solidity
function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) public virtual override returns (uint256)
```

Withdraws an `amount` of underlying `asset` from the reserve, burning the equivalent aTokens owned. For example, if a user has 100 aUSDC and calls withdraw(), they will receive 100 USDC, burning the 100 aUSDC.

If user has any existing debt backed by the underlying token, then the maximum `amount` available to withdraw is the `amount` that will not leave user's health factor < 1 after withdrawal.

> [!NOTE]
> When withdrawing `to` another address, `msg.sender` should have `aToken` that
> will be burned by `Pool`.

> [!NOTE]
> Reserves with a Loan To Value parameter of 0% must be disabled as collateral
> (using `Pool.setUserUseReserveAsCollateral` or by fully withdrawing the
> supplied balance) before other assets can be withdrawn.

function borrow(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interestRateMode,
    uint16 referralCode,
    address onBehalfOf
) public virtual override
```

Allows users to borrow a specific `amount` of the reserve underlying `asset`, provided the borrower has already supplied enough collateral, or they were given enough allowance by a credit delegator on the corresponding debt token (VariableDebtToken). For example, if a user borrows 100 USDC passing their own address as `onBehalfOf`, they will receive 100 USDC into their wallet and 100 variable debt tokens.

> [!NOTE]
> NOTE: If `onBehalfOf` is not the same as `msg.sender`, then `onBehalfOf` must
> have supplied enough collateral via `supply()` and have delegated credit to
> `msg.sender` via `approveDelegation()`.

> [!NOTE]
> Referral program is currently inactive, you can pass `0` as `referralCode`.
> This program may be activated in the future through an Aave governance
> proposal.

function repay(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interestRateMode,
    address onBehalfOf
) public virtual override returns (uint256)
```

Repays a borrowed `amount` on a specific reserve, burning the equivalent debt tokens owned. For example, if a user repays 100 USDC, the 100 variable debt tokens owned by the `onBehalfOf` address will be burned.

> [!WARNING]
> When repaying, the `Pool` contract must have allowance to spend funds on
> behalf of `msg.sender` for at least the `amount` for the asset you are
> repaying with. This can be done via the standard ERC20 `approve()` method on
> the underlying token contract.

### repayWithATokens

```solidity
function repayWithATokens(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode
) public virtual override returns (uint256)
```

Allows a user to repay a borrowed `amount` on a specific reserve using the reserve aTokens, burning the equivalent debt tokens. For example, a user repays 100 USDC using 100 aUSDC, burning 100 variable debt tokens. Passing `uint256.max`as the amount will clean up any residual aToken dust balance, if the user aToken balance is not enough to cover the whole debt.

#### Input Parameters:

| Name             | Type      | Description                                                                                                                  |

### setUserUseReserveAsCollateral

```solidity
function setUserUseReserveAsCollateral(address asset, bool useAsCollateral) public virtual override
```

Allows suppliers to enable/disable a specific supplied asset as collateral. Sets the `asset` of `msg.sender` to be used as collateral or not.

> [!NOTE]
> An asset in [Isolation Mode](../aave-v3) can be enabled to use as collateral
> only if no other asset is already enabled to use as collateral.

> [!NOTE]
> An asset with LTV parameter of 0% cannot be enabled as collateral.

> [!NOTE]
> The user won’t be able to disable an asset as collateral if they have an outstanding debt position which could be left with the Health Factor < `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` on disabling the given asset as collateral.

#### Input Parameters:

| Name            | Type      | Description                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| asset           | `address` | The address of the underlying asset supplied                                |
| useAsCollateral | `bool`    | `true` if the user wants to use the supply as collateral, `false` otherwise |

### liquidationCall

```solidity
function liquidationCall(
    address collateralAsset,
    address debtAsset,
    address user,
    uint256 debtToCover,
    bool receiveAToken
) public virtual override
```

Function to liquidate a non-healthy position collateral-wise, with Health Factor below 1.

When the health factor of a position is below 1, the caller (liquidator) repays the `debtToCover` amount of debt of the user getting liquidated. This is part or all of the outstanding borrowed amount on behalf of the borrower. The caller then receives a proportional amount of the `collateralAsset` (discounted amount of collateral) plus a liquidation bonus to cover market risk.

Liquidators can decide if they want to receive an equivalent amount of collateral aTokens instead of the underlying asset. When the liquidation is completed successfully, the health factor of the position is increased, bringing the health factor above 1.

Liquidators can only close a certain amount of collateral defined by a close factor. Currently the **close factor is 0.5**. In other words, liquidators can only liquidate a maximum of 50% of the amount pending to be repaid in a position. The liquidation discount applies to this amount.

- _In most scenarios_, profitable liquidators will choose to liquidate as much as they can (50% of the `user` position).
- `debtToCover` parameter can be set to `uint(-1)` and the protocol will proceed with the highest possible liquidation allowed by the close factor.
- To check a user's health factor, use [`getUserAccountData()`].

> [!NOTE]
> Liquidators must `approve()` the `Pool` contract to use `debtToCover` of the
> underlying ERC20 of the `asset` used for the liquidation.

| data | `uint256` | Bitmap of the users collaterals and borrows. It is divided into pairs of bits, one pair per asset. The first bit indicates if an asset is used as collateral by the user, the second whether an asset is borrowed by the user. The corresponding assets are in the same position as `getReservesList()`. For example, if the hex value returned is `0x40020`, which represents a decimal value of `262176`, then in binary it is `1000000000000100000`. If we format the binary value into pairs, starting from the right, we get `1 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00`. If we start from the right and move left in the above binary pairs, the third pair is `10`. Therefore the `1` indicates that third asset from the `reserveList` is used as collateral, and `0` indicates it has not been borrowed by this user |

### getReserveNormalizedIncome
